PayFriends Paper Plane Images
==============================

This directory should contain 25 transparent PNG files of paper airplanes:

  plane-01.png
  plane-02.png
  plane-03.png
  ...
  plane-25.png

These images are used by the PayFriendsPaperPlaneBackground.js component
to create the animated background on the login page.

Requirements:
- Files must be named exactly as shown above (with zero-padded numbers)
- Files should be transparent PNG images
- Recommended size: 200-400px width for optimal performance
- All planes will be randomly scaled between 0.7x and 1.4x during animation

The component will gracefully handle missing images and display a warning
in the console if any images fail to load.
