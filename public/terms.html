        <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          Welcome to PayFriends. By accessing or using the PayFriends platform (the "Service"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service (these "Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not use the Service.
        </p>
        <p>
          PayFriends is owned and operated by PayFriends ("we," "us," or "our"). These Terms constitute a legally binding agreement between you and PayFriends.
        </p>

        <h3>2. What PayFriends Does</h3>
        <p>PayFriends is a personal loan tracking and record-keeping tool. Specifically, PayFriends:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Allows you to record details of loans you have made to friends or family</li>
          <li>Helps you track loan balances, payments, and repayment schedules</li>
          <li>Provides a simple interface to manage and communicate about existing loans</li>
          <li>Stores and displays your loan records for your personal reference</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. What PayFriends Does NOT Do</h3>
        <p>PayFriends is not a financial institution, lender, or payment processor. We explicitly do NOT:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Provide loans, credit, or any form of financing</li>
          <li>Facilitate money transfers or payments of any kind</li>
          <li>Collect, hold, or transmit money on your behalf</li>
          <li>Report to credit bureaus or affect credit scores</li>
          <li>Create legally binding loan contracts (though we may help you document existing agreements)</li>
          <li>Provide financial, legal, or tax advice</li>
          <li>Guarantee loan repayment or offer collection services</li>
          <li>Act as an intermediary in your loan transactions</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          All loans tracked through PayFriends are arranged, funded, and repaid entirely outside of our platform. PayFriends is simply a tool to help you remember and organize information about loans that you have already made independently.
        </p>

          IN NO EVENT SHALL OUR TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID TO US IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRIOR TO THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM.
        </p>
        <p>
